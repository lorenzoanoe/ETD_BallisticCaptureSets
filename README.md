# ETD_BallisticCaptureSets
This repository contains Matlab scripts and datasets for the generation of the ETD Ballistic Capture sets.

1. Download the Matlab scripts (.m files) "figure_ETD_BCset.m" and "LagrangePoints.m", as well as the datasets (.mat) in the same folder.
2. Run the Matlab script "figure_ETD_BCset.m". Inside this, you can tailor the capture set you want to be plotted.
