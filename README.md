# ETD_BallisticCaptureSets
This repository contains Matlab scripts and datasets for the generation of the ETD Ballistic Capture sets.
This codes are related to the paper "Ballistic Capture Analysis using the Energy Transition Domain" by L. Ano√®, C. Bombardelli, and R. Armellin, which was published in the Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics!

1. Download in the same folder:
   - the Matlab scripts (".m" files) "figure_ETD_BCset.m" and "LagrangePoints.m";
   - the "datasets" subfolder (containing Matlab structures ".mat").
2. Run the Matlab script "figure_ETD_BCset.m". Inside this, you can tailor the capture set you want to be plotted.

The subfolder "datasets" contains all the resulting ETD Ballistic Capture sets for the Sun-Jupiter and Earth-Moon systems. Some higher definition results are available only for Earth-Moon system, with Gamma=0.80:0.04:1.36.

Additional figures for the ETD Ballistic Capture sets and some result figures can be found in the folder "Figures".
